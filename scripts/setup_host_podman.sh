# scripts/setup_host_podman.sh — host bootstrap for rootless-podman hosts.
#
# Selected by setup_host.sh when SETUP_HOST_OS=podman, or automatically when
# the host is RHEL/Fedora-family with podman present and no docker.
#
# This is deliberately NOT a port of setup_host_linux.sh. That script installs,
# via apt: Docker CE pinned to 28.x, sysbox-runc, and postfix. None of those
# apply here and two of them would be actively wrong:
#
#   * Docker + sysbox-runc — sysbox is a Docker-only OCI runtime shim; it needs
#     sysbox-mgr/sysbox-fs daemons and a rootful dockerd. There is no podman
#     equivalent, and installing rootful Docker alongside an existing rootless
#     podman setup would fragment image storage for no gain. Rootless podman's
#     user namespace already provides the host-filesystem isolation this
#     sandbox depends on.
#
#   * postfix — only feeds the optional email-notify hooks, which no-op when
#     CLAUDE_NOTIFY_EMAIL is unset. Installing and configuring a system MTA is
#     not a reasonable price for a feature that is off.
#
# So this script VERIFIES rather than installs. It touches no system state: no
# package installs, no systemd units, no writes outside the sandbox tree. The
# only thing it creates is the sandbox directory layout and the host-side
# fiss-mcp venv.
#
# Nothing here handles authentication. Terra/GCP access uses whatever gcloud
# credentials already exist on the host, and the operator runs any
# `gcloud auth login` themselves. Claude Code authenticates itself inside the
# container on first launch, with its own token and no host credential.

Nothing was installed and no system state was changed.

This is step 4 of "Per-user setup" in the README. Continue there with step 5.

The README is the single source of truth for the ordering; this script does not
repeat it, so the two cannot drift apart.

Note: you do NOT build the container image. An admin builds it once into a shared
read-only store (scripts/build-shared-image.sh), so every user provably runs the
same image, and 'make' is deliberately absent from the host.

No log-out/log-in is needed: rootless podman uses no docker group.
