# build-shared-image.sh — build the sandbox image once into a shared, read-only
# image store so N users do not each hold their own 9.0 GB copy.
#
# Run as root (the store must be populated by a real uid, not by one user's
# subuid range — see the note on ownership below):
#
#     sudo ./scripts/build-shared-image.sh
#
# Users then get the image read-only through `additionalimagestores` in their
# own containers-storage.conf, which scripts/provision-sandbox-user.sh writes.
#
# Why a shared store rather than each user building or pulling:
#   * 9.0 GB once instead of 9.0 GB x N users.
#   * Everyone provably runs the same image. Users cannot rebuild it, which is
#     a feature here: the image is the trust boundary, and drift between users
#     would make "it works for me" unfalsifiable.
#
# Verified mechanism: with an empty graphroot plus an additional store, podman
# lists the image as ReadOnly=true, runs it without copying, and the local
# graphroot stays at ~150 KB.

Done. Each user picks this up through ~/.config/containers/storage.conf.

IMPORTANT ordering: a user sees nothing from this store until that file exists.
provision-sandbox-user.sh writes it, so run that FIRST. Checking \`podman images\`
before provisioning shows an empty list and \`podman run\` falls back to a registry
pull -- which looks like the shared store failing when it is simply not
configured yet.

The file it writes:

    [storage]
    driver = "overlay"
    [storage.options]
    additionalimagestores = [ "${STORE}" ]
    [storage.options.overlay]
    mount_program = "/usr/bin/fuse-overlayfs"

The mount_program line is REQUIRED. This store is built by rootful podman, whose
overlay layers carry trusted.overlay.* xattrs; a rootless consumer mounts with
userxattr and cannot read them, so the container starts with an incomplete
rootfs and fails with "OCI runtime attempted to invoke a command that was not
found". The image lists fine in that state -- only running breaks -- so the
symptom is easy to misread. fuse-overlayfs handles ownership in userspace and
fixes it.

scripts/provision-sandbox-user.sh writes that automatically. Verify as a
NON-admin user with:

    podman images                      # should list claude-sandbox, ReadOnly=true
    podman run --rm localhost/claude-sandbox:${TAG_VERSION} claude --version
    du -sh ~/.local/share/containers   # should stay small: no local copy

To update the image later, re-run this script. Users need do nothing; they pick
up the new layers on their next launch. Anyone with a container already running
keeps the old image until they exit and relaunch.

Each rebuild leaves the previous image dangling as <none>, holding another ~8 GB.
Reclaim it with:

    sudo ./scripts/build-shared-image.sh --prune

Use that rather than calling podman prune directly. prune rewrites the store
metadata as root 0600, which undoes the chmod this script applies, and users then
hit "configure storage: open .../overlay-images/images.json: permission denied" on
every command. --prune restores the permissions in the same breath. The same
hazard applies to ANY rootful operation on this store: if you touch it by hand,
re-run \`sudo chmod -R a+rX ${STORE}\` afterwards.
