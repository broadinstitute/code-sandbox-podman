# env.gcp.example.sh — template for one user on a shared GCP VM.
#
# scripts/provision-sandbox-user.sh renders this into env.<USER>.sh with the
# __USER__ / __USER_ROOT__ placeholders filled in. You normally do not copy it
# by hand.
#
#   source env.<USER>.sh && ./run_claude_docker.sh
#
# Differences from env.podman.example.sh (the single-user local template):
#   * every path lives under a per-user directory on the DATA DISK, because
#     home directories are on the small boot disk and the 8.3 GB image plus
#     workspaces do not fit there;
#   * the fiss-mcp venv is moved out of the checkout, so one read-only clone
#     can be shared by every user;
#   * the shared-state dir is per-user, since the container mounts it
#     read-write and users must not write into a shared checkout.

# Per-container RAM ceiling. Enforced for real only when the cgroup v2 memory
# controller is delegated to your user slice — provision-sandbox-user.sh checks
# that and warns if not.
#
# Sizing on a shared host: this is the limit that decides how many people can
# run at once, not disk. An e2-highmem-8 has 64 GB, so 16g allows about three
# concurrent sandboxes before the host is oversubscribed. Drop to 8g if more
# people need to work simultaneously.

# Read-only context, bind-mounted to /context. This is where you put material the
# agent should READ but never modify: plans, specs, notes, a data dictionary.
#
# Deliberately your own directory, not the shared checkout. It used to point at
# __REPO_ROOT__/context_reference, which is the ADMIN's tree: read-only to everyone
# else, so the one channel meant for "drop a file in for the agent" was the one
# channel a user could not write to. Now provisioning creates this for you.
#
# The mount is :ro, so the agent cannot change what you put here — that is the
# difference from /workspace, and the reason to use it for a plan you do not want
# rewritten.

# REQUIRED for fiss-mcp's GCS tools. They build a bare storage.Client(), which
# refuses to construct without a project, so without this
# list_gcs_objects / read_gcs_object / download_gcs_file /
# get_gcs_object_metadata all fail with
#   OSError: Project was not passed and could not be determined from the environment
#
# Note that `gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project` does NOT satisfy
# this: it sets quota_project_id, but google.auth.default() still reports
# project=None. Set a project where YOU have serviceusage.services.use.
#
# Default for the WARP deployment. A GCP project id is not a secret and grants
# nothing on its own — reach comes from your own IAM on the buckets. Change it if
# you are deploying elsewhere; the only requirement is that you hold
# serviceusage.services.use on whatever you name.

# Terra MCP. The server runs on the HOST as you, using your own gcloud ADC. The

export FISS_MCP=1

# Headroom token-compression proxy. Be aware of what it does: start_script.sh

# to talk to api.anthropic.com directly.
