# Rootless podman. Docker is not installed on this host and sysbox-runc does
# not exist for podman, so the launcher drops the sysbox runtime and
# Docker-in-Docker, and pins the container to the image's claude uid with
# --userns=keep-id so /workspace files stay owned by the invoking user.
export CLAUDE_SANDBOX_ENGINE=podman

# Hard RAM ceiling for the container. Enforced for real: cgroup v2 delegates
# the memory controller to this user's slice, so --memory/--memory-swap read
# back inside the container (verified: memory.max = 17179869184).
#
# Sized to stay portable to a GCP VM — 16g fits an n2-standard-4 (4 vCPU /
# 16 GB) with nothing to spare for the host, and sits comfortably on an
# n2-standard-8 (8 vCPU / 32 GB). This host has 31 GB.

# Leave CPU unrestricted (host has 20 cores). Set to e.g. 8 to cap.

# GPU passthrough is opt-in and off. This host has an NVIDIA card, but
# rootless podman needs a CDI spec (/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml, generated with
# `sudo nvidia-ctk cdi generate`) which is not installed. Setting this to 1
# without that spec prints a warning and continues without the GPU.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------- state ----

#
# The container holds no git credentials (no ssh keys, no ssh-agent socket, no
# ~/.git-credentials, no ~/.netrc, no gh, no tokens, no credential helper), so
# `git push` to an authenticated remote cannot succeed from inside; remote
# state stays host-controlled. Local history and uncommitted work in these
# checkouts are NOT protected, especially in bypassPermissions mode.

# Headroom token-compression proxy, ON.
#
# Be aware of what this does: start_script.sh sets
# ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8787, so every Anthropic API request
# from inside the container — including its Authorization header — passes
# through the third-party `headroom` binary (pip headroom-ai, upstream
# github.com/chopratejas/headroom) before egress. Set to 0 to have claude
# talk to api.anthropic.com directly.

# fiss-mcp: Terra/GCP access. The server runs on the HOST and is reached over
# a pasta loopback forward; the container has no gcloud, no gsutil, no
# google-cloud-* libraries and no ~/.config/gcloud mount, so these MCP tools
# are the only path from the sandbox to Terra.
#
# Auth is entirely host-side: the server inherits this host's gcloud ADC.
# Nothing is injected into the container.
export FISS_MCP=1

# GCP project for the host fiss-mcp server's GCS tools. REQUIRED for those
# tools: they construct a bare storage.Client(), which refuses to build without
# a project ("Project was not passed and could not be determined from the
# environment"). Note that `gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project`
# does NOT satisfy this -- it sets quota_project_id, but google.auth.default()
# still reports project=None. Pick a project where you have
# serviceusage.services.use; it is a quota/API-enablement project only and
# grants no bucket access of its own.

#export CLAUDE_SANDBOX_GCP_PROJECT=my-project

# Read-only.
#
# Note how this is actually enforced, because the upstream README describes it
# imprecisely. All 21 tools stay REGISTERED and visible in tools/list at 0 --
# including the five write tools (submit_workflow, abort_submission,
# update_method_config, copy_method_config, upload_entities). The block happens
# at call time: each of those five begins with _check_write_access(ctx), which
# raises ToolError when ALLOW_WRITES is false. Verified against this install by
# calling submit_workflow and abort_submission with valid arguments -- both
# returned "This server is running in read-only mode."
#
# Practical consequence: the agent can see the write tools and may try one; it
# will be refused rather than being unable to name it. The protection is real
# but it is a runtime guard, not absence from the tool list.

# Claude Code auto-updater. Off, because it cannot work in this image and the
# warning is noise on every launch: npm global (/usr/local/lib/node_modules) is
# root-owned from build time while the container runs as claude, the path is not
# bind-mounted, and the container runs --rm -- so an update would be discarded
# on exit and re-downloaded next launch, drifting off the pinned
# CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION. Upgrade by bumping that pin and re-running make.
#export DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=0
